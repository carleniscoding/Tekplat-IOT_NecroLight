# 🔧 Fixing Vercel 404 Error - Step by Step

## The Problem
You're getting a `404: NOT_FOUND` error because Vercel can't properly serve your Flutter web app files.

## ✅ Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed File Structure
- ✅ Moved all Flutter web files to root directory
- ✅ Updated `vercel.json` with proper routing
- ✅ Rebuilt the app with latest Flutter build

### 2. Updated Configuration
Created a comprehensive `vercel.json`:
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "index.html",
      "use": "@vercel/static"
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "^/assets/(.*)",
      "dest": "/assets/$1"
    },
    {
      "src": "^/canvaskit/(.*)",
      "dest": "/canvaskit/$1"
    },
    {
      "src": "^/icons/(.*)",
      "dest": "/icons/$1"
    },
    {
      "src": "^/(.*\\.(js|css|png|jpg|jpeg|gif|ico|svg|woff|woff2|ttf|eot))",
      "dest": "/$1"
    },
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. Added .vercelignore
To prevent uploading unnecessary files and reduce deployment size.

## 🚀 How to Fix Your Deployment

### Option 1: GitHub Auto-Deploy (Recommended)
1. **Commit all changes** to your GitHub repository:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Vercel deployment configuration"
   git push origin main
   ```
2. **Vercel will automatically redeploy** within 1-2 minutes
3. **Check your app** at `https://tekplat-iot-necro-light.vercel.app`

### Option 2: Manual Deploy via CLI
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI (if not installed)
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy from project root
vercel --prod
```

### Option 3: Manual Deploy via Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Find your project
3. Go to Settings > Git
4. Click "Redeploy" or "Trigger Deploy"

## 🔍 What Should Work Now

After redeployment, your app should:
- ✅ Load the NecroLight login screen
- ✅ Show proper branding and assets
- ✅ Allow login with any credentials (demo mode)
- ✅ Navigate to dashboard with updating sensor data
- ✅ Work on mobile devices
- ✅ Handle all routing correctly

## 🐛 If You Still Get 404

### Check These:
1. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for deployment to complete
2. **Clear browser cache** (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
3. **Try incognito/private mode**
4. **Check Vercel dashboard** for deployment status

### Verify Files:
The root directory should contain:
- ✅ `index.html` (main entry point)
- ✅ `main.dart.js` (your Flutter app)
- ✅ `flutter.js` & `flutter_bootstrap.js` (Flutter web engine)
- ✅ `assets/` folder (your images/assets)
- ✅ `canvaskit/` folder (Flutter rendering)
- ✅ `vercel.json` (deployment config)

## 📱 Test Your Deployment

Once working, test these features:
1. **Login page** loads with NecroLight branding
2. **Login works** with any email/password
3. **Dashboard shows** with sensor data bars
4. **Emergency contacts** feature accessible
5. **Mobile responsive** design works
6. **Navigation** between screens works

## 🎯 Your Live App URL

`https://tekplat-iot-necro-light.vercel.app`

The configuration is now correct. Just push the changes and your NecroLight app will be live! 🚀

**Next Steps:** Commit and push your changes, then wait 1-2 minutes for automatic redeployment.
